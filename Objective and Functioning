This is a quiz bot. This is basically designed as a part of our college assignemnt to design our first wep page.

The player can play this quiz to either test their knowledge or to randomly play to cure their boredom

This quiz bot starts when the player comes to it's web page. It asks him random questions about GK,space,math,english etc.
There are 10 questions to be answered
For each question you are given 10points if your answer is correct.
This bot is designed in such a way that you cannot skip any questions.
There are no negetive points if you answer it wrong so you can give a random answer if you don't know!!!

If you say any answer wrong,you will get a pop up saying which answer is correct.
There comes an alert message even if you miss any question.
Soo..answer the quiz properly and see your score to estimate your knowledge in small facts.

you can relaod the page if you want to play again.
